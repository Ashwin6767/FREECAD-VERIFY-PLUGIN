# VerifyImagePlugin

FreeCAD plugin for visual verification using silhouette comparison between the current CAD view and a user-provided photo.

## Setup

1. Create and activate a Python 3.11 virtual environment (optional for development):

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv311
source .venv311/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: Inside FreeCAD, PySide2 is provided by FreeCAD. You do not need to install PySide2 via pip for runtime inside FreeCAD. For local linting outside FreeCAD, you can skip UI usage.

## Installation (FreeCAD)

- Copy or symlink the `VerifyImagePlugin` folder into your FreeCAD `Mod` directory, e.g. on macOS:
  `~/Library/Preferences/FreeCAD/Mod/VerifyImagePlugin`
- Launch FreeCAD, switch to the "Verify Image" workbench. Use the toolbar button "Verify with Image".

## Usage

1. Align your 3D model view to match your photo perspective.
2. Click "Upload Photoâ€¦" and select your image.
3. Click "Run Verification" to compute shape similarity and view the overlay.

## Development

- Core logic is in `VerifyImagePlugin/ImageProcessor.py`.
- UI is in `VerifyImagePlugin/VerifyImageTaskPanel.py`.
- Workbench setup is in `VerifyImagePlugin/InitGui.py` and command in `VerifyImagePlugin/VerifyImageCommand.py`.

## Limitations

- CAD silhouette capture assumes a white background and uses the largest contour as the model outline.
- For complex scenes or non-white backgrounds, tweak thresholding in `ImageProcessor.generate_cad_silhouette`.
